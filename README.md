Hello, 
This is my second Odin-Project assignment. It should demonstrate the degree of comfort I have in my abilities until this point using html, css and version control. The technology mainly used in my implementation of the assignment is Flexbox. The layout of index.html is made up of nested flex containers and flex items.
Sincerely, 
Yasser
